# Weekly Status Report — Week 2


---

## Team Report 

### i. Last week’s goals
- **John & Yasir:** Complete Firebase authentication and set up the database.
- **Eshan & Mohamed:** Complete draft UI for **user registration** and **profile setup**, then implement.
- **Masroor:** Connect the frontend and backend.
- **Team:** Get feedback on pitch and plans, then make changes as needed.
- **Longer-term (2–3 weeks):** Short-term matching v1 (availability + muscle group); Discover feed (read-only).

### ii. Progress and issues

**Progress**
- Initial software architecture created for the new pitch.
- Database schema created 
- New updated document drafted for our new pitch.

**Issues / Risks**
- Choosing our database and archeticture tools gave us some trouble since there were a lot of things to consider and disagreements that were resolved in the team.
- Creating the database schema and ensuring that the database relationships were accurate also took time, and while we feel confident in it, we will be sure to keep this part flexible to account for any errors. 
- We are currently not stuck on anything. 

### iii. Plans and goals for the next week (with owners)
- **John & Yasir:** Create backend routes and logic for storing and retrieving profile data.
- **Eshan & Mohamed:** Build the profile display and the edit section connected to real user data.
- **Masroor:** Oversee data flow between frontend and backend for profile functionality, assisting the other two groups if needed.
- **Team:** A user can create, edit, and view their own profile without errors.
