/**
 * Tests for the long-term partner compatibility score.
 *
 * We assume `calculateCompatibilityScore(me, partner)` returns a number 0â€“100
 * based on:
 *  - schedule overlap weight
 *  - workout split compatibility
 *  - goal alignment
 *  - experience level fit
 *  - gym proximity
 *
 * and that the function rejects self-match.
