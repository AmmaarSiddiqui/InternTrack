# InternTrack
InternTrack is a web-based platform designed to make the internship search process more organized, transparent, and motivating for students. Instead of using messy spreadsheets, InternTrack allows users to upload or enter their application data and automatically visualize their progress through charts, funnels, and streak trackers.
The platformâ€™s goal is to help students identify bottlenecks, maintain consistency, and stay accountable while also enabling advisors and peers to view anonymized progress summaries. By turning the internship hunt into a structured, data-driven experience, InternTrack reduces stress and fosters collaboration.

### Project Goals
- Provide students with dynamic visualizations of their internship applications.
- Replace scattered spreadsheets with a centralized, automated dashboard.
- Have an all-in-one solution to find jobs and internships while tracking them.
- Encourage accountability and motivation through streaks and peer comparisons.
- Maintain data privacy and flexibility, supporting multiple input formats (CSV, Google Sheets).
