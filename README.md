# Partner & Pump
Partner & Pump is an iOS app that helps gym-goers find compatible workout partners based on their schedules, training style/split, goals, and location. It then keeps gym-goers motivated with a lightweight social feed for PRs and highlights. Instead of luck-based DMs or generic fitness forums, Partner & Pump uses a matching algorithm that is tailored to gym-goer's needs for both same-day sessions and long-term training partners.

The appâ€™s goal is to make gym partner finding fast, intentional, and consistent. By combining structured matching with simple social features and clear profiles, Partner & Pump reduces the back-and-forth, lowers the barrier for beginners, and builds community around shared routines and results.
### Project Goals
- Match users by availability, workout split, goals, and proximity (short-term & long-term).
- Provide clear profiles and a compatibility score to reduce guesswork.
- Offer a simple Discover feed for PRs, clips, and encouragement.
- Enable real-time chat and notifications to coordinate sessions quickly.
- (Stretch) Support shared workout schedules and wearable sync for progress tracking.
